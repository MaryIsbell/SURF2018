                  Alexander, the Emperor of Greece, and by him carried to his Capital at Conſtantinople; from whence, after having lived with great
                  virtue, ſhe was baniſshed through the means of a falſe accuſer, whom the had ferverely checked for his imprudence; and though at the
                  ſame time ſhe was big with Child, yet ſhe was compelled to <pb n="3"/><fw type="header" place="top">( 3 )</fw><lb/>leave her
                  huſband's empire, to the great regret of the people, attended only with a ſquire named Blandiman.</p>
               <p>After great fatigue and travel, ſhe arrived in the foreſt of Orleans, where finding her pains come thick upon her, ſhe diſmiſſed her
                  attendant for a midwife, but before his return was delivered of two lovely children, one of which was conveyed away by a ſhe bear,
                  but ſhe willing to ſave it purſued on her hands and knees, leaving the other behind.</p>
               <p>But before her return, King Pepin being a hunting in the foreſt, came to the tree where ſhe left the other babe, and cauſing it to
                  be taken up, ſent it to nurſe, and when it grew up called his name Valentine.—Blandiman at length came back, and inſtead of finding
                  his miſtreſs found her brother Pepin at the tree, to which he declared all that had happened, and how his ſiſter was baniſhed
                  through the falſe ſuggeſtions of the arch prieſt; which when King Pepin heard he was greatly enraged againſt the lady Belliſant,
                  ſaying the Emperor ought to have put her to death; ſo leaving Blandiman, he returned to his nobles at Paris.—The lady Belliſant
                  having followed the bear to no pur<pb n="4"/><fw type="header" place="top">( 4 )</fw><lb/>poſe, returned to the place where ſhe had
                  left the other babe; but great was her ſorrow when Blandiman ſaid he had ſeen her brother Pepin, but could tell nothing of the
                  child; and having comforted her for the loſs of it, they went to the ſea-ſide took ſhipping, and arrived at the caſtle of the Giant

                  till he was impeached by a merchant of having wrongfully accuſed the Empreſs; upon which they fought, and the merchant conquering,
                  made the prieſt confeſs all his treaſons, the Emperor wrote about it to the King of France, and he was hanged.</p>

                  ſon: commanding him to be taught the uſe of arms, in which he ſoon became ſo expert, that few in the court dared to encounter him:
                  which made Hufray and Heny the King's baſtard ſons exceedingly envy him. At this juncture great complaints were made againſt the
                  Wild Man, from whom no Knight had eſcaped with his life, that had encountered him: which made the King promiſe a thouſand marks to
                  any that would bring him dead or alive, which offer none dare except; but Hufray and Henry deſired King Pepin to ſend Valentine,
                  with a view of getting rid of ſo powerful a rival in the King's favour, but his Majeſty ſeeing their malady, was very angry, telling
                  them, he would rather loſe the beſt Baron in the land.</p>

               <p>However Valentine deſired leave of his Majeſty to go to the foreſt, reſolving either to conquer the Wild Man, or die in the attempt.
                  Accordingly having furniſhed himſelf with a good horſe and arms, he ſet forward on his journey, and after two days travelling, he
                  arrived in the foreſt; in the evening he tied his horſe to a large ſpreading oak, and got up in a tree himſelf, for his ſecurity,
                  where he reſted that night.</p>
               <p>Next morning he beheld the Wild Man traverſing the foreſt in ſearch of his prey, at length he came to the tree where Valentine's
                  horſe ſtood, from whom he pulled many hairs, upon which the horſe kicked him. The Wild Man feeling the pain, was going to tear him
                  to pieces, which Valentine ſeeing, made ſigns as if he would fight him, and accordingly he leaped down, and gave him a blow, but the
                  Wild Man caught him and threw him to the ground. Then taking up Valentine's ſhield, he beheld it with amaze, with reſpect to the
                  divers colours thereon emblazoned.</p>
               <p>Valentine being much bruiſed, got up and went towards his brother in great anger: but Orſon ran to a tree, and the <pb n="7"/><fw

                  ſigned to Orſon, that if he would yield to him, he would order matters ſo as he ſhould become a rational creature.</p>
               <p>Orſon thinking that he meant him no harm, ſtretched forth his hand to him; upon which he bound him, and then led him to Paris, where
                  he preſented him to King Pepin, who had the Wild Man baptized by the name of Orſon, from his being taken in a wood. Orſon's
                  actions<!-- ct ligature --> during their ſtay there very much amuſed the court, that at length the Duke of Acquitain ſent letters

                  the reaſon that they came there, were preſented to Fazon; to whom Valentine thus addreſſed himſelf:</p>
               <p><said>"Sweet creature, King Pepin has ſent me hither with the braveſt Knight in all his realm to fight the Green Knight, who though

               <p>During this ſpeeched ſhe viewed Orſon narrowly, and he her; but ſupper coming in, interrupted them, and they ſat down to eat.</p>
               <p>Whilſt they were in the midſt of all their feaſtings, the Green Knight entered ſaying, <said>Duke Acquitain haſt thou any more

                  <said>Yes</said>, replied the Duke, <said>I have ſeventeen</said>, and then ſhewed them to <pb n="9"/><fw type="header" place="top"

                  hearing what he ſaid, was much incenſed againſt him, and ſuddenly riſing from the table, threw the Green Knight with ſuch force
                  againſt the wall as laid him dead for ſome time; which very much pleased the whole company.</p>
               <p>Next day many Knights went to fight the Green Knight, but he overcame and ſlew them all; till at laſt, Orſon being armed in
                  Valentine's armour, came to the Green Knight's pavilion, and defying him, they began the moſt deſperate combat as ever was heard of,
                  and the Green Knight made ſo great a ſtroke at him, as to cut of the top of his helmit, half his ſhield, and wounded him much. But
                  this ſerved only to enrage the valiant Orſon, who coming up to him on foot, took hold of him, and pulled him from his horſe, got
                  aſtride him, and was juſt going to kill him, but was prevented by the ſudden arrival of Valentine, who interceded with Orſon to
                  ſpare his life, on condition of his turning Chriſtian, and acquainting King Pepin how he was conquered.</p>

                  their parents. After dinner, the lady took them by the hand, and led them to the chamber of rarieties, where the Head was placed
                  between four pillars of pure jaſper, when, as they entered it made the following ſpeech to Valentine:</p>
               <p><said>"Thou famous Knight of royal extract art called Valentine the vlaient, who of right ought to marry the lady Clerimond. Thou

               <p>The Brazen Head having ended his ſpeech, Valentine embraced Orſon and cut the thread which grew under his tongue; and he directly
                  related many ſurpriſing things. After which Valnetine married Lady Clerimond, but not before ſhe turned Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>In this caſtle lived a dwarf, named Pacolet, who was an enchanter, and by his art had contrived a horſe of wood, and in the forehead

               <p>This enchanter flies to Portugal, and informs Feragus of his ſiſter's nuptials, and of her turning Chriſtian; which ſo enraged him
                  that he ſwore by Mahomet he would make her rue it, and thereupon he got ready his fleet, and ſailed towards the castle of Clerimond,
                  where when he arrived he concealed his malice from his fiſter, and alſo the two Knights, telling them that he came to fetch them
