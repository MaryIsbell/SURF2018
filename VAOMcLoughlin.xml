            <caption>THE EMPEROR'S CRUELTY TO BELLISANT.</caption>
         </figure>
         <ab>Long year ago, and Emperor <lb/>A man of might and fame; <lb/>Married a wife, and fair, was she, <lb/>And Bellisant her name.</ab>
         <pb/>
         <figure>
            <caption>ORSON CARRIED AWAY BY THE BEAR.</caption>
         </figure>
         <ab>And true and happy were thier lives, <lb/>Until an envious man; <lb/>A courtier, high in place and trust, <lb/>An evil tale began.</ab>
         <pb n="4"/>
         <fw>4 Valentine and Orson.</fw>
         <ab>'Twas said, this did not love, <lb/>Her royal husband dear; <lb/>And thus an honest wife was made, <lb/>Untruthful to appear. </ab>
         <ab>The Emperor believed the tale, <lb/>And drove her from his side; <lb/>And through the cruel forest glades, <lb/>She wandered far and
            wide.</ab>
         <ab>Without a friend, without a guide, <lb/>The hapless lady goes; <lb/>Unarmed, except with innocence, <lb/>All burdened whith her
            woes.</ab>
         <ab>To Pepin's court her steps were bent, <lb/>Her brother HE, and king, <lb/>Of mighty France, in that old time, <lb/>Of which I now shall
            sing.</ab>
         <ab>And as she fled, weighed down by grief, <lb/>And sense of cruel scorn; <lb/>Lo! in the forest, two fair sons, <lb/>To Bellisant were
            born.</ab>
         <pb n="5"/>
         <fw>Valentine and Orson. 5</fw>
         <ab>All weak and suffering she lay; <lb/>Yet with a mother's joy, <lb/>She pressed her babies to her breast, <lb/>And kissed each lovely
            boy.</ab>
         <ab>And now, with her returning strength, <lb/>The poor, unhappy wife, <lb/>Began to seek her brother's court, <lb/>And pray for health and
            life.</ab>
         <ab>One day, while her attendant went <lb/>For food, a great she-bear, <lb/>Sprung from a copse, and bore away <lb/>ONE child unto its
            lair.</ab>
         <ab>Poor Bellisant pursued the beast, <lb/>And tore her lovely hair; <lb/>Ah me, alas! when she returned, <lb/>The OTHRER was not there.</ab>
         <ab>Then up and down the forest drear, <lb/>She vainly sought relief; <lb/>Till at a convent's friendly gate, <lb/>She sank, o'ercome with
            grief.</ab>
         <pb/>
         <figure>
            <caption>VALENTINE FOUND BY KING PEPIN.</caption>
         </figure>
         <ab>And long in sorrow there she dwelt, <lb/>For many a weary year; <lb/>Believing cruel Death had borne, <lb/>Away her children dear.</ab>
         <pb/>
         <figure>
            <caption>YOUNG ORSON PLAYING WITH THE BEARS.</caption>
         </figure>
         <ab>Now Pepin chanced, that very day, <lb/>To hunt with all his train; <lb/>In that same wood, and found the child <lb/>Ere she came back
            again.</ab>
         <pb n="8"/>
         <fw>8 Valentine and Orson.</fw>
         <ab>Said Pepin, <said>"this is very strange, <lb/>This boy shall now be mine; <lb/>He'll make a pretty play-fellow, <lb/>For litle
               Eglantine."</said></ab>
         <ab><said>"And by my faith,"</said> the king went on, <lb/><said>"I never wrote a line; <lb/>Yet I will rhyme his name with hers, <lb/>And
               call him Valentine."</said></ab>
         <ab>Thus reared within that nobel court, <lb/>A knight he soon became; <lb/>Whose courtesy and valor blazed, <lb/>Upon the roll fame.</ab>
         <ab>And all his noble deeds were done, <lb/>In praise of Eglantine; <lb/>Who, though her brothers hated him, <lb/>Loved gentle
            Valentine.</ab>
         <ab>And now, how fared the tender babe, <lb/>Borne off while still alive? <lb/>The wild bear nursed him tenderly, <lb/>And nobly did he
            thrive.</ab>
         <pb n="9"/>
         <fw>Valentine and Orson. 9</fw>
         <ab>Trough all the country round about, <lb/>As Orson, he was known; <lb/>And with him roamed his brother bear; <lb/>He never went
            alone.</ab>
         <ab>And Pepin's knights, though armor-clad <lb/>With sword and lance complete, <lb/>Whene'er they fronted Orson's might, <lb/>Were crushed
            with sore defeat.</ab>
         <ab>Then said the gentle Valentine; <lb/><said>"I'll seek this monster, when <lb/>He thinks himself secrue and safe, <lb/>I'll beard him in
               his den."</said></ab>
         <ab>But scarcely had he reached the wood, <lb/>When Orson came in sight; <lb/>And man and beast, with horrid yells, <lb/>Rushed fiercely on
            the knight.</ab>
         <ab>High in the air, a mighty tree, <lb/>Does Orson lightly weild; <lb/>Then drops it, with fearful clang, <lb/>Upon his foeman's
            shield.</ab>
         <pb/>
         <figure>
            <caption>THE COMBAT BETWEEN VALENTINE AND ORSON.</caption>
         </figure>
         <ab>But when he saw his savae face, <lb/>Look from the glitt'ring round; <lb/>With fright and horror overcome, <lb/>He grovelled on the
            ground.</ab>
         <pb/>
         <figure>
            <caption>ORSON CHAINING AGRAMONT.</caption>
         </figure>
         <ab>Then Valentine, with lifted biade, <lb/>And fiercely gleaming eye; <lb/>Unto the kneeling monster said, <lb/><said>"Yield quickly, or you
               die!"</said></ab>
         <pb n="12"/>
         <fw>12 Valentine and Orson</fw>
         <ab>So Valentine was conqueror. <lb/>Brave Orson owned his might; <lb/>And lovingly he followed him, <lb/>And served him day and night.</ab>
         <ab>And thus we see how time and tide, <lb/>Brings many a wondrous thing;â€” <lb/>One brother reared by savage bears, <lb/>The other by a
            king.</ab>
