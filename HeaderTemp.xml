                <p>This project encodes various chapbook, picture book, and other versions of the medieval romance story, Valentine and Orson, using
                    the extensible markup language for detailed presentation of the text. The goal of the project is to create a digital archive of
                    available versions of this story with project specific encoding guidelines created in accordance with the Text Encoding Initiative
                    P5 Guidelines. The editions and project guidelines are available on the TEI Archiving, Publishing, and Access Service and GitHub
                    repositories. </p>
